# MLOps-Project - End-to-End ML System with Ray, MLflow, and FastAPI

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end MLOps pipeline** for training, tracking, and deploying a machine learning model using:


- **Ray** for distributed training and data processing  
- **PyTorch** for model development  
- **MLflow** for experiment tracking and model registry  
- **FastAPI + Ray Serve** for serving models via an API
